# 🚗 Car Dash Game (Unity Prototype)

A small **endless runner prototype** built in Unity featuring lane switching, swipe controls, and a smooth tween-based car tilt animation using **DOTween**.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This project focuses on responsive lane-changing mechanics and visual polish through procedural rotation and easing.  
It was built as part of my learning journey to improve in **Unity C# scripting, animation control, and player feedback design**.

---

## 🕹️ Core Features
- Swipe or arrow key input for lane switching  
- Subtle tilt during dashes using yaw + roll combination  
- Smooth motion driven by **DOTween** sequences  
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile testing  
- Clean, extensible code structure for future features (obstacles, coins, etc.)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Managing **rotation relative to prefab orientation** (`neutralLocalRot`)  
- Avoiding float comparisons by tracking lane indexes  
- Structuring DOTween **Sequences** for concurrent motion and rotation  
- Setting up Unity projects with Git and documentation best practices
